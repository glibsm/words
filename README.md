They are just words on a page.
Why overcomplicate things?

## What is this repo

A way to easily put up a very simple blog if all you really want to do is focus
on the content, not faffing around with configuration, tempating and other
stuff.

Note this is a library, not a binary to be consumed.

See [example](example) directory for a complete example of a blog with a few
posts.

## Oh dear, not another one...

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I know I know. Yes, there are many other ways to create a blog. Everyone has
heard of `hugo` and `jekyll`. You are free to use whatever works for you. From
what I've been able to conjure up so far this seems like it will work for me.

## Status

Like... hella bugs. At some point it will be tagged with `v0.1.0`, but you're
welcome to use at your own risk.

Oh, yeah, there are also no tests. I'll gladly add them once this prototyping
shape starts to settle down.

## Features

Minimal so far, somewhat by design. It should get you going with the important
thing, though, which is writing your "*.md" content and having it served
somehow, someway.
